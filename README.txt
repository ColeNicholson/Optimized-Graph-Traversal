      Part 1: The graph is represented in the form of an adjacency list where vertexList holds each 'header node' where each subsequent edge pointer
      	      represents a vertex adjacent to that header node. Observe the buildGraph() function to see the implementation.
      Part 2: The graph is topologically sorted via a queue based source removal algorithm. See topologicalSort() function for the implementation.

Note: Runtime for the large input sets is longer than it needs to be because the program will print the graph representation. I thought this was necessary for showing the adjacency list.
      All of the expected output items will occur at the bottom of the outfile after the graph representation is complete.
